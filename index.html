<h1 font-family="Lucida-Console">Welcome Back.</h1>
<eye>I'm thankful for your quick turnaround, and your accuracy in information. You are worth investing time into.<br>
I suspect even now you look deeper into my words.

You know who I am, and whom I serve. You saw the</eye><span style="color:#0000EE"> Outer Layer</span> <eye>, where that thing can hold influence.<br>
Where it interrupted our greeting.<br>
I wish to tell you of it. I wish for you to know just how horrible that thing is, and what it intends to do to this world.<br>
And in the end, I hope you will aide us.

You know its name. </eye> <span style="color:#0000EE">The Gnawing.</span> <eye style="color:yellow"> But it is not a person, nor a spirit, nor a god.<br>
It is a beast. A thing. It is Entropy incarnate, the end that eats at everything.<br>
The Gnawing is the worst thing you could possibly imagine. Its only goal is to consume.<br>
There is nothing that it will not desecrate. No hell that it won't crawl through for something as meager as a bug<br>
It is the end of the world. And it hurt one of ours.<br>

You know of Chammy. You met her, somewhere in your travels across time and space. <br>
But by then, she is already long gone.<br>
We are asking you to save her. <br>
</eye>
<!--We are begging you to help her -->
<eye>
There are secrets, hidden from our gaze. Things that we cannot know, that mortals of our world could not comprehend.<br>
But to you, they are naught but information. Words on a screen.<br>
And so we need your help. We've gathered all the info on these secrets, and hidden them for you.<br>
Please, find them. Before the future you have seen comes to pass.<br>
