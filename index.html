<title>And so it begins.</title>
<gnaw font-family="Brush Script MT">Greetings, dear watchers. You stand upon sacred ground, never before touched by the child of man.<br>
You commit heresy simply by breathing here. And yet you stand, unafraid. We are impressed.<br>
We will one day consume you. But you care not. You will be dead long before we reach you, with your short, insignificant life.<br>
We watch you wither. A waste of a meal<br>
Curse you, little Qualia. You protect them too much. You and your King.</gnaw>
<p></p>
<eye font-family="Lucida-Console">Greetings. Our apologies for the interruption.<br>
You already know who we are. We will not spoonfeed.<br>
But do you know what the one who interrupted was?<br>
Consider that the first puzzle.<br>
When it is answered, we will know. And we will allow you deeper into our mind.</eye>
<h1 font-family="Lucida-Console">You know where to send it.</h1>
