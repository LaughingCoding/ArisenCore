<title>And so it begins.</title>
<p font-family="Brush Script MT">Greetings, dear watchers. You stand upon sacred ground, never before touched by the child of man.</p>
<p font-family="Brush Script MT">You commit heresy simply by breathing here. And yet you stand, unafraid. We are impressed.</p>
<p font-family="Brush Script MT">We will one day consume you. But you care not. You will be dead long before we reach you, with your short, insignificant life.</p>
<p font-family="Brush Script MT">We watch you wither. A waste of a meal</p>
<p font-family="Brush Script MT">Curse you, little Qualia. You protect them too much. You and your King.</p>

<p font-family="Lucida-Console">Greetings. Our apologies for the interruption.</p>
<p font-family="Lucida-Console">You already know who we are. We will not spoonfeed.</p>
<p font-family="Lucida-Console">But do you know what the one who interrupted was?</p>
<p font-family="Lucida-Console">Consider that the first puzzle.</p>
